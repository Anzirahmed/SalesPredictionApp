# SalesPredictionApp
A sales prediction App using R
This R Shiny app is an interactive Sales Prediction Dashboard that uses a linear regression model to predict sales based on advertising spend for TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The dashboard connects to a MySQL database (advertising_db), lets users adjust advertising costs with sliders, and displays both the predicted sales value and a regression visualization built with ggplot2. Developed with shinydashboard, it provides an intuitive interface for exploring the relationship between advertising investments and sales outcomes.
